# Group Meeting 

There were four main meetings that were made throughout the assignment. Each meeting we discussed and assigned each other tasks that we needed to do. Each meeting corresponded with each milestone, hence there being four total meetings. The contents of each meeting is summarised below.

## Meeting 1 (Milestone 1 - 60 min)
During this meeting, we discussed which group member was responsible for the bug fixes in milestone 1. We came to the following conclusion:
  
* **Anthony:**
  * Incorrect change values
  * No ending cash register balance displayed

* **Tin:**
  * Makefile compilation error
  * Lack of dollar signs before cash values

* **Bijay:**
  * Spelling error prompts
